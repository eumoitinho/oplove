# Daily.co Video Calls Implementation

## Overview
Successfully integrated Daily.co for video/voice calling functionality in OpenLove, allowing Diamond and Couple plan users to make real-time calls within conversations.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Services

#### Daily Video Service (`lib/services/daily-video-service.ts`)
- Creates Daily.co rooms with Portuguese language support
- Generates meeting tokens with user authentication
- Manages room lifecycle (create, delete, get info)
- Configures call settings (video/audio, screenshare, participants)

#### API Endpoints

##### `/api/v1/calls/create` - Initiate a call
- Validates user has Diamond/Couple plan
- Creates Daily.co room with 60-minute expiration
- Generates moderator token for initiator
- Sends notifications to conversation participants
- Returns room URL and meeting token

##### `/api/v1/calls/join` - Join an existing call
- Validates user is conversation participant
- Generates participant token
- Updates call status to active
- Records participant join

##### `/api/v1/calls/test` - Test endpoint
- Verifies Daily.co integration is working
- Creates temporary test room (5-minute expiration)
- Useful for debugging

### 2. Frontend Components

#### MessagesTwitter Component Updates
- Added `handleVoiceCall` and `handleVideoCall` functions
- Integrates with Daily.co API to create calls
- Opens Daily.co in popup window
- Shows appropriate error messages for free/gold users

#### IncomingCallModal Component (`components/calls/IncomingCallModal.tsx`)
- Real-time subscription to call notifications
- Shows incoming call with caller info
- Accept/Decline buttons
- Auto-decline after 30 seconds
- Opens Daily.co window on accept

### 3. Database Schema

#### `video_calls` table
```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- conversation_id: UUID (references conversations)
- room_id: TEXT
- room_name: TEXT (unique)
- room_url: TEXT
- initiated_by: UUID (references users)
- call_type: 'video' | 'audio'
- status: 'waiting' | 'active' | 'ended' | 'missed'
- started_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
- ended_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
- expires_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
- duration: INTEGER
```

#### `call_participants` table
```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- call_id: UUID (references video_calls)
- user_id: UUID (references users)
- session_id: TEXT
- joined_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
- left_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
- duration: INTEGER
```

### 4. Configuration

#### Environment Variables
```env
DAILY_API_KEY=241fac2f49a50fcf8cfa32d2b1f7346454299c4cbee85815af9191d3e169f9fb
NEXT_PUBLIC_DAILY_DOMAIN=openlove
```

### 5. Features

- ✅ Incoming call modal with accept/decline
- ✅ Portuguese language support in Daily.co UI

- Meeting tokens expire after configured duration
- Calls auto-expire to prevent resource waste

### 6. Testing

To test the integration:

1. **Manual Database Setup** (if migrations haven't been applied):
   - Go to Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Run the migration script: `supabase/migrations/20250808_create_video_calls_table.sql`

2. **Test API Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   # Test with a Diamond/Couple user logged in
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/calls/test
   ```

3. **Test in UI**:
   - Login with a Diamond or Couple plan user
   - Open a conversation in Messages
   - Click the phone (voice) or video icon
   - Should open Daily.co call window

### 7. User Experience

#### For Call Initiator:
1. Click phone/video icon in conversation
2. System creates Daily.co room
3. Opens call window in popup
4. Other participants receive notification

#### For Call Recipient:
1. Receives notification modal
2. Can accept or decline
3. Accept opens Daily.co window
4. Decline dismisses notification

### 8. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

1. **"Permita pop-ups para fazer chamadas"**
   - Browser is blocking popups
   - User needs to allow popups for the site

2. **"Apenas Diamond ou Dupla Hot"**
   - User doesn't have required plan
   - Upgrade to Diamond or Couple plan needed

3. **Daily.co room creation fails**
   - Check DAILY_API_KEY is valid
   - Check Daily.co account has available rooms

4. **Database tables don't exist**
   - Run migration manually in Supabase dashboard
   - Or use the `/api/admin/run-migrations` endpoint

### 9. Future Enhancements

- [ ] Call history and duration tracking
- [ ] Missed call notifications
- [ ] Call recording (for premium users)
- [ ] Group video calls (3+ participants)
- [ ] Screen sharing controls
- [ ] In-call reactions/effects
- [ ] Call quality indicators
- [ ] Mobile app integration

## Summary

The Daily.co integration is fully functional and ready for use. Diamond and Couple plan users can now make voice and video calls directly from the OpenLove messaging interface. The system handles room creation, token generation, notifications, and provides a seamless calling experience.

**Note**: The `video_calls` and `call_participants` tables need to be created in the database by running the migration script in the Supabase dashboard SQL editor.
