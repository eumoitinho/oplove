# Database Consolidation Migration - v0.3.5
**Date**: 2025-08-08  
**Status**: Ready for deployment

## Overview

This migration consolidates and standardizes all interaction tables in the OpenLove database, ensuring consistency and eliminating duplications.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Table Naming Standardization

All interaction tables now follow the `post_` prefix convention:

| Old Name | New Name | Status |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `comments` | `post_comments` | ✅ Migrated |
| `likes` | `post_likes` | ✅ Already correct |
| `shares` | `post_shares` | ✅ Created |
| `saves` | `post_saves` | ✅ Created |
| `reposts` | `post_reposts` | ✅ Created |

### 2. New Features Added

#### Collections System
- `saved_collections` table for organizing saved posts
- Users can create multiple collections (private/public)

#### Enhanced Interaction Tracking
- Standardized counter columns in posts table:
  - `likes_count`
  - `comments_count`
  - `shares_count`
  - `saves_count`
  - `reposts_count`

### 3. Database Triggers

Created unified trigger system for automatic counter updates:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION update_post_counter()
-- Automatically updates counters on INSERT/DELETE
-- Applied to all interaction tables
```

### 4. Performance Optimizations

Added comprehensive indexes for all interaction tables:
- Primary key indexes
- Foreign key indexes
- Composite indexes for timeline queries
- Created date indexes for sorting

### 5. Row Level Security (RLS)

Implemented consistent RLS policies across all tables:
- Users can view all public interactions
- Users can only create/delete their own interactions
- Private saves only visible to owner

## Code Updates

### API Endpoints Updated

All API endpoints have been updated to use the new standardized table names:

1. `/api/v1/posts/[id]/comments/route.ts` - Using `post_comments`
2. `/api/v1/comments-simple/route.ts` - Using `post_comments`
3. `/api/v1/posts/[id]/details/route.ts` - Using `post_comments`
4. `/api/v1/posts/with-comments/route.ts` - Using `post_comments`
5. `/api/v1/comments/[id]/reactions/route.ts` - Using `post_comments`
6. `/services/posts.service.ts` - Using `post_comments`

### Migration File

Created comprehensive migration: `20250808_consolidate_interactions.sql`

Key features:
- Safe migration with data preservation
- Automatic detection of existing tables
- Data migration from old to new tables
- Cleanup of duplicate tables
- Recalculation of all counters

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Backup Database
```bash
# Create backup before migration
pg_dump -h [host] -U [user] -d [database] > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

### 2. Apply Migration
```bash
# Apply via Supabase CLI
npx supabase db push

# Or apply directly to database
psql -h [host] -U [user] -d [database] -f supabase/migrations/20250808_consolidate_interactions.sql
```

### 3. Verify Migration
```sql
-- Check all tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE 'post_%';

-- Verify counters are accurate
SELECT id, likes_count, comments_count 
FROM posts 
LIMIT 10;
```

### 4. Monitor Performance
- Check query performance after migration
- Monitor trigger execution times
- Verify RLS policies are working correctly

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, use the following rollback:

```sql
-- Restore comments table name
ALTER TABLE post_comments RENAME TO comments;

-- Note: Other changes are additive and don't need rollback
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] All likes functionality working
- [ ] Comments can be created/viewed/deleted
- [ ] Reposts working with modal
- [ ] Saves working with collections
- [ ] Shares tracking properly
- [ ] Counters updating in real-time
- [ ] RLS policies enforced correctly
- [ ] Performance acceptable (<400ms)

## Impact Analysis

### Positive Impacts
- Consistent naming convention
- Better performance with proper indexes
- Automatic counter updates via triggers
- Cleaner codebase with standardized references
- Support for new features (collections, reposts)

### Potential Issues
- Brief downtime during migration (est. 2-5 minutes)
- Counter recalculation may take time on large datasets
- Need to ensure all frontend references are updated

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to staging** - Test migration on staging environment
2. **Performance testing** - Verify <400ms latency requirement
3. **Production deployment** - Schedule maintenance window
4. **Monitor metrics** - Track performance post-deployment
