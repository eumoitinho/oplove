# Types Directory Context

## Purpose and Responsibilities
- TypeScript type definitions for the entire application
- Database schema types (generated from Supabase)
- API response and request types
- Component prop types
- Shared interfaces and enums

## Dependencies
### External
- None (pure TypeScript definitions)

### Internal
- None (base types for other modules)

## Exported Types
- `Database` - Complete database schema
- `User` - User entity type
- `Post` - Post entity type
- `ApiResponse<T>` - Generic API response wrapper
- `PaginatedResponse<T>` - Paginated data response
- `AuthState` - Authentication state type

## State Management Approach
- No state management (type definitions only)

## Related API Endpoints
- Types are used across all API endpoints

## Testing Approach
- Type checking during build process
- No runtime tests needed for types
